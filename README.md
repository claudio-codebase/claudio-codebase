### hello! my name is claudio (they/them). ðŸ›¹ðŸ’»ðŸŒ¤ðŸŽ§ðŸŒ±

i am currently a computer science student at pomona college in claremont, california. having lived, worked, and studied out of los angeles and orange counties, i currently reside on unceded tongva land. on campus, i am involved in student governance, diversity and equity initiatives, and educational advocacy.

this summer 2024, i am working as an intern at microsoft in redmond, wa -- unceded coast salish land and duwamish land.

i am a technologist and community advocate. i seek to learn from marginalized voices and stories to create a liberatory world alongside those who have been working toward this goal for years.

in particular, i am interested about asking questions related to education access and alternative histories/realities of computing. what might it look like to have a care-first approach to learning and connecting? how might present digital solutions serve as an extension of colonization across the globe? how might we connect the information we consume to what we learn to become and what does that say about us as 'users'? i ask myself these questions everyday at school, work, and home. 

i am otherwise very interested in new digital media projects, art museums, urban planning and advocacy, sticker street art, used bookstores, and attending local concerts.

please reach out to me via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudio-r-castillo/) if you have any ideas or questions.
