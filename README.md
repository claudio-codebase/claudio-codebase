i am currently a computer science student at pomona college in claremont, california. having lived, worked, and studied out of los angeles and orange counties, i reside on tongva land.

this past summer, i participated in microsoft and cyborg mobile's TNT program as a [new technologist]. there, my team and i worked on a project to protect women against the harms of deepfake technologies through a MVP prototype primarily built in React. this was an amazing opportunity to blend my passion for social advocacy, tactful human-centered engineering, and technology.

i currently work as a service desk supervisor at pomona college information technology services. i also provide campus tours, lead panels, and staff outreach events as a tour guide at the pomona college office of admissions. during the spring 2024 semester, i will serve as a teaching assistant for cs 051p - introduction to computer science in the department of computer science at pomona college. 

on campus, i am a head coordinator for [black and brown in computer science](https://www.instagram.com/bbicspomona/), serve on the board for [the latinx alliance](https://www.instagram.com/pomonalxa/), and sit on the academic affairs committee. through these positions and volunteering at the draper center for community partnerships, i advocate for education and technology equailty/access.

during summer 2024, i will be an explorer intern at microsoft.

i am passionate about technology, new digital media/art, social advocacy, amplifying educational and professional opportunities, urban systems, museums, bookstores and small scale farming.
